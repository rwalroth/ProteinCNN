# ProteinCNN
Code for analyzing protein sequences using convolutional neural nets 

This repository contains code necessary to take in amino
acid sequences and convert them into numeric arrays readable
by neural networks. The goal of the project is to convert amino acid 
sequence data into numeric arrays, and train neural networks on
the resulting arrays. 

Required modules:

numpy
pandas
sklearn
tensorflow
matplotlib
